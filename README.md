# DP-SDV

## Implementations

1. Tabular Preset

So, adding noise based on the Wishart Mechanism for Differentially Private Principal Components Analysis paper's algorithm 1. Lap(0, 2d/ne), in this d is the number of columns in the covariance matrix taken from `model.get_parameters()`. Now, taking sensitivity=1. We modify the covariance matrix.

2. GaussianCopula Model

So, adding noise based on the Wishart Mechanism for Differentially Private Principal Components Analysis paper's algorithm 1. Lap(0, 2d/ne), in this d is the number of columns in the covariance matrix taken from `model.get_parameters()`. Now, taking sensitivity=1. We modify the covariance matrix.

3. CTGAN Model
